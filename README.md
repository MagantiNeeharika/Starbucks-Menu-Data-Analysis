# Starbucks Menu Data Analysis
This modest data analysis endeavor revolves around a compact **'Starbucks Menu'** dataset, primarily crafted to highlight my proficiency in **Tableau** and serve as a practice exercise. Despite its relatively small scale, the dataset was cleaned using **MS Excel** to address missing data and eliminate extra whitespaces.
I have analyzed 'Starbucks Menu Dataset' and have created an Interactive Dashboard in **Tableau** showcasing Nutritional Information and other information for all the Starbucks Beverages of all type as well as practical application of my **Data Analysis** and **Visualization skills**.

This repository contains a dataset providing nutrition information for Starbucks menu items. This dataset includes details on Beverage Categories, specific drink names, preparation methods, and nutritional content.

### Objective/ Aim
This analysis aims to offer insights into the nutritional aspects of **Starbucks Beverages**, making it a valuable resource for dietitians and health-conscious consumers.
